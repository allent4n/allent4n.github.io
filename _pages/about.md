Ciao~
My name is TAN Zusheng, Allen. I hold an M.Sc. degree in Information Systems from the Department of Computer Science at Baptist University, Hong Kong, which I completed in 2019. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the [***School of Data Science at Lingnan University, Hong Kong***](https://www.ln.edu.hk/sds), where I am deeply engaged in research that spans several fascinating areas.

My research interests include information systems, machine learning, deep learning, federated learning and NLP. These fields offer immense potential for innovation and practical applications, and I am passionate about exploring how they can be leveraged to address complex challenges in today's digital landscape. Currently, I am working on projects involving NLP, with a particular focus on summarization. The ability of NLP to distill vast amounts of textual data into concise and meaningful summaries is incredibly powerful. I am dedicated to advancing this field through my research, aiming to develop more sophisticated and efficient summarization techniques.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been driven by a desire to understand and develop technologies that enhance our interaction with information and improve decision-making processes. My experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in data science and a keen interest in contributing to its dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape.

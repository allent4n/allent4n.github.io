Ciao~
My name is TAN Zusheng, Allen. I hold an M.Sc. degree in Information Systems from the Department of Computer Science at Baptist University, Hong Kong, which I completed in 2019. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the [***School of Data Science at Lingnan University, Hong Kong***](https://www.ln.edu.hk/sds), where I am deeply engaged in research that spans several fascinating areas.

I have been working in the research field including information systems and federated learning before. Currently, I am working with [***Prof. Billy Chiu***](https://billy322.github.io/) on projects involving NLP, with a particular focus on summarization. I am dedicated to advancing this field through my research, aiming to develop more sophisticated and efficient summarization techniques.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been driven by a desire to understand and develop technologies that enhance our interaction with language and improve NLP capabilities. My experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in NLP and a keen interest in contributing to its dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape.

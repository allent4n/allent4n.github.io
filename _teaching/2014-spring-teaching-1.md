Uni-SciSum is a novel multimodal scientific summarisation model for multimodal output. VAT-Sum aims to enable LMs to effectively utilize textual, visual and audio content for scientific document summarisation. With the use of Q-Former, our model can effectively fuse these multimodal inputs and feed them into the lightweight LM for efficient summarisation. This lightweight LM facilitates efficient downstream adaptation without sacrificing performance.
